<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for art. I would always doodle something in the sketchbooks my parents
would give me, whether it was characters from TV shows or movies I watched growing up, or the silly little characters
I would make up in my head. Now, I find myself doing digital art and creating my original characters! I go by the pseudonym, SnoCone, on my social media
platforms.</p>
